# Ex7 Priority Queue
## DATE:03/03/2025
## AIM:
To formulate the C code to display the elements of the priority queue after insertion and deletion operation.

## Algorithm
1. Start 
2. Define a function printArray() that takes an array and its size as parameters. 
3. Loop through the array from index 0 to size-1. 
4. Print each element of the array during the loop. 
5. After printing all elements, print a newline for formatting. 
6. End 

## Program:
```

void printArray(int array[], int size) {
  int i;
  for(i=0;i<size;++i){
      printf("%d ",array[i]);
  }
}
```

## Result:
Thus, the C program to display the elements of the priority queue after insertion and deletion operation is implemented successfully
